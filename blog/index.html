		<h3>The War of the Worlds</h2>
		<p class="first-p">I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of exhausting themselves.  After a time I discovered that I was cold and wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet.  I got up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some whiskey, and then I was moved to change my clothes.</p>

		<p>After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I do not know.  The window of my study looks over the trees and the railway towards Horsell Common.  In the hurry of our departure this window had been left open.  The passage was dark, and, by contrast with the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed impenetrably dark.  I stopped short in the doorway.</p>

		<p>The thunderstorm had passed.  The towers of the Oriental College and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red glare, the common about the sand pits was visible.  Across the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro.</p>

		<h3>At the Earth's Core</h2>
		<p class="first-p">Ahead we neither saw nor heard any sign which might betoken the success of Hooja's mission.  By now he should have reached the outposts of the Sarians, and we should at least hear the savage cries of the tribesmen as they swarmed to arms in answer to their king's appeal for succor. In another moment the frowning cliffs ahead should be black with primeval warriors.  But nothing of the kind happened&mdash;as a matter of fact the Sly One had betrayed us.</p>

		<p>Hooja still harbored ill will against me because of the blow I had struck in Dian's protection, and his malevolent spirit was equal to sacrificing us all that he might be revenged upon me.</p>

		<p>As we drew nearer the barrier cliffs and no sign of rescuing Sarians appeared Ghak became both angry and alarmed, and presently as the sound of rapidly approaching pursuit fell upon our ears, he called to me over his shoulder that we were lost.</p>
